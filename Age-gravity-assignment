Write a program that
Stores a person age
Stores the earths gravity as 9.8



In the swift programming language we can use the let and var keywords used to declare the variables and the constants respectively.

var keyword is used to declare the variable. The Datatypes avvailable in swift programing language is:

bool (True or False),

Integer(Int8, UInt),

float,

double,

character,

String.

a).Declaring age variable (By assuming it as int):

var age: Int=21

print(age)

b).Declare a constant earth gravity (By Taking it as Float you can take Double also):

let earth_gravity:Float=9.8

print(earth_gravity)

The difference between variable and constant is a variable can be updated where as the constant which could not be updated once it had assigned.

So, Finally We had declared age as variable using var keyword and earcth gravity as Constant which constant using let keyword.

We can use int8 or UInt for age and Double for earth gravity.
