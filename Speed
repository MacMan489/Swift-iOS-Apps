Given the following:

var speed : Double
var parkedDriver = 0, slowDriver = 0, fastDriver = 0
Assume that the variable speed will be assigned a value from 0 to 100. Write one if/else-ifstatement that will:

Increment BY 1 the parkedDriver variable if the speed is equal to 0

Increment BY 1 the slowDriver variable if the speed is less than 55

Increment BY 1 the fastDriver variable if the speed is greater than or equal to 55

temperatures[ ] is an array of type double that has been declared and initialized threshold is a variable of type double 
that has been declared and initialized Write Swift code to Count the number of values in array temperatures that are greater 
than threshold, and output the count to the console



















Program 1: Single if/else if statement to Determine the Driver's Speed

/*An variable named speed in which an value between 0-100 can be assigned*/

var speed: Double

/*Three variables parkedDriver,slowDriver,fastDriver to determine the stype of driver based on the speed*/

var parkedDriver=0,slowDriver=0,fastDriver=0

/*Checking if the driver parked the vehicle*/

if(speed==0)

{

parkedDriver+=1

}

/*Checking if the driver is driving the vehicle slowly*/

else if(speed>=0 and speed<55)

{

slowDriver+=1

}

/*Checking if the driver is driving the vehicle fastle*/

else if(speed>=55)

{

fastDriver+=1

}

Progam 2: Counting the number of values in the temperature array that are greater than treshold

/*An array of doubles named temperatures to store the values*/

var temperatures: [Double] = []

/*An variable of type double, called treshold */

var treshold = Double(48)

/*Inserting values into the temperatures*/

for i in 1...10

{

temperatures.append(Double(i*10))

}

/*Printing the temperature array onto the console*/

print("The values in the temperature array are:\n")

print(temperatures)

print("\n")

/*An variable named count to keep track of the number of temperature values in the array that are greater than the treshold value*/

var count=0

/*An loop to iterate over the temperatures array*/

for temp in temperatures

{

/*Checking whether an temperature value is greater than treshold variable or not*/

if(temp>treshold)

{

/*Updating the count variable*/

count=count+1

}

}

/*Printing the count variable onto the console*/

print("Number of values in array temperature that are greater than treshold are: "+String(count))
